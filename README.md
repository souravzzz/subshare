subshare
========

A simple file sharing program

Subshare is a small and simple file sharing program I wrote as an undergrad assignment.

It is windows only (may run on mono) and uses .net

It has two parts, a command line server that you fire up and keep running and clients.

You should give clients the server to connect to and a dierctory to be shared. (hey, don't be a leech!)

Then you can see what other clients have shared and download stuff :)

Note: I developed this in [Sharpdevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx).
Should be compatible with Visual Studio without any change.

TODO: handle concurrent multiple transfers.

Warning: has a lot of cheesy comments you may or may not find funny ;)
